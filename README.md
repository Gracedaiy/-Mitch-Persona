# "Mitch" -- persona for intelligent email #

## Introduction ##
Email is where many people receive and process most of their communication and much of their incoming information. Much of this information needs to be re-accessed over time. Processing email is time intensive and can be quite cognitively demanding.

Tags can help us retrieve email more quickly and easily, saving us time and sparing us frustration. Yet tags are not free to make and use. In most circumstances, it takes significant cognitive effort to construct a useful and comprehensive set of tags for email. In recent times, machine learning has been applied to make tags simpler and easier for people to use. Most of this machine learning has not involved end-users however. It is still an expensive endeavor to train an intelligent tagging assistant even if the potential pay-off is rewarding.

## Reasons for choosing person ##
The software has evolved in a variety of ways over these years and continues to evolve. When an opportunity to use the personas technique became available, there was considerable interest in using this technique for the email assistant. Briefly, per Wikipedia, a description of a persona:

*“A user persona is a representation of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized group of users. In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users. They are captured in 1–2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. For each product, more than one persona is usually created, but one persona should always be the primary focus for the design.”*

Using personas to help improve the design and development process is a natural fit as there are different types of users of the email assistant. Currently, design and development processes do not adequately represent these different users and their various roles.
