Dear Shahed,

Thank you for your help in developing our expert user persona for the intelligent email project. 

The persona is now ready for action. We would appreciate the opportunity to introduce the finished version of "Mitch" and discuss how we will be using "Mitch" in the future.

The introduction meeting for "Mitch" is currently scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday Feb 17th at 5:15pm in KEC2057.

Best regards,

Rasha, Sruti, Ying, Michael
